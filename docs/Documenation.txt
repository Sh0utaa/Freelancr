This project is a backend API for FreelancR.
FreelancR is a freelancing platform for connecting businesses with talent.

About this API:
its an ExpressJs API using Typescript, it utilizes the repository and unit of work patterns.
the ORM is Prisma for the Postgres database which is hosted on railway.app
using Scalar UI for the API endpoint visulisation on `/docs` route

the repositories abstract the database logic layer from the controllers which are all united by the unit-of-work.ts file
then these repositories are utilized in the contorllers where we define our endpoints with "tsoa" instead of writing
YAML files for the directories inside the contorllers themselves.

added Scalar UI with tsoa, tsoa defines the API endpoints and running the scrips 
`npx tsoa routes && npx tsoa spec` automatically defines the api routes in swagger.json which 
then we use in app.ts to configure the controllers, in the scalar UI we can see the endpoints, 
the controllers are set up the repositories and interfaces are also set up we can start coding

you don't need to make custom models in express becausae prisma Schemas automatically generate the Models.
added basic CRUD operations to user model, DTOs aren't nesessary in Typescript because they have their own Utility types 
which is rly cool. now im going to add PassportJs for login and registration for JWT auth tokens and password encryptions
